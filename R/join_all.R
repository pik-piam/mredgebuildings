#' Join by all common columns
#'
#' Additional columns to join by that have different names can be give. The kind
#' of joint can also be specified.
#'
#' @param x,y A pair of data frames
#' @param by character vector of columns to join by beyond the commonly named
#' @param .direction type of dplyr join, 'left' by default
#' @param exclude character vector with column names that should be excluded
#'   from the search for join columns
#' @param silent boolean, whether to print type of joint the join columns
#' @param ... additional arguments passed to join function
