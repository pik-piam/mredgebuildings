\usage{
calcLifetimeParams(subtype, granularity = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{subtype}{character, type of asset (either 'building', 'heatingSystem'
or 'buildingShell')}

\item{granularity}{character, name of BRICK granularity}
}
\value{
MagPIE object with Weibull lifetime distribution parameters
}
\description{
Parameters for the lifetime of heating systems are taken from a very
detailed EIA publication for building sector appliances and equipment. The
range of the building shell lifetime is taken from Skarning et al. 2017.
}
\details{
The standing lifetime is estimated assuming a steady state, i.e. constant
flows and stock. For shape parameters > 2, it is roughly half of scale
parameter.
