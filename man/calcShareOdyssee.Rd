\description{
Shares are calculated based on energy demands in households and services from
the Odyssee data base (EU member states). In case of multi-level shares, the
function gives the share w.r.t. to the last categories but for all
categories. E.g. 'enduse_carrier' gives the share of each carrier in the
demand from each end use.
Missing shares that result from missing demand data are filled with the
average share across all regions and periods and then normalised to sum up to
one again.
Biomass is split according to GDP per Capita (see toolSplitBiomass).
