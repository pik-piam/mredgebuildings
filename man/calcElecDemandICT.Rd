\title{Calculate Electricity Demand for ICT from Data Center Demands}
\usage{
calcElecDemandICT(endOfHistory = 2025, extrapolate = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{endOfHistory}{upper temporal boundary for historical data}

\item{extrapolate}{if \code{TRUE}, regional demand will be linearly extrapolated using the slope
of the last two existing data points per scenario, if \code{FALSE} data remains unchanged}
}
\value{
A magpie object containing ICT electricity demand data calculated from
DC demands across regions, time periods, and scenarios.
}
\description{
This function processes historical and scenario electricity demand data for
Information and Communication Technology (ICT) and data centers (DC). The initial data
comes from exogenous projections using the Digital Transformation Level (DGI)
as the primary driver of demand, with IEA data serving as the historical baseline.
}
\details{
The function processes multiple demand estimates:
\itemize{
\item Mean and central estimate
\item Lower demand boundary (DGI elasticity from historical efficiency dominant phases)
\item Upper demand boundary (DGI elasticity from historical service dominant phases)
}

Data is downscaled from R5 to country-level using historical DC counts,
with fixed network shares calculated at the end of the historical period. Historical
data (IEA Base) is separated and harmonized with SSP scenario projections.
