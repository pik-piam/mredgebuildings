\title{Calculate Extrapolated Air Conditioning Ownership Rates with Regional Calibration}
\usage{
calcACOwnershipRatesFilled(endOfHistory = 2025)
}
\arguments{
\item{endOfHistory}{last period of historical data (default: 2025)}
}
\value{
magpie object with filled AC ownership rates for all regions (1990-endOfHistory)
}
\description{
This function fills AC ownership rates for all regions from 1990 to endOfHistory using
global regression parameters (alpha, beta, gamma, delta) with region-specific GDP shifts.
The GDP shift (gdppopShift) is calculated for each region to horizontally shift the
global S-curve along the GDP axis so that it passes through the region's most recent
historical data point. This calibrates the global curve to match available historical
data while maintaining the same functional form across all regions.
}
\details{
The logistic formula used is:
\deqn{penetration = 1 / (1 + \exp(\alpha - \beta \cdot (gdppop - gdppopShift)^\delta \cdot CDD^\gamma))}

Regions without historical data use the global curve as-is (gdppopShift = 0).
